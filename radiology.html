            <h3><u><i>Overview</i></u></h3>
            <ul>
                <h3>Department Structure</h3>

                <li><b>Diagnostic Radiology: </b>Provides imaging services to diagnose various medical conditions using techniques like X-rays, CT scans, and MRIs.</li>
                <li><b>Interventional Radiology: </b>Performs minimally invasive procedures guided by imaging, such as angiograms, biopsies, and stent placements.</li>
                <li><b>Nuclear Medicine: </b>Uses small amounts of radioactive materials to diagnose and treat diseases, including PET scans and radioactive iodine therapy.</li>
                <li><b>Ultrasound: </b>Utilizes high-frequency sound waves to produce images of organs, tissues, and blood flow, commonly used in obstetrics and abdominal imaging.</li>
            </ul>
            <ul>
                <h3>Facilities and Equipment</h3>

                <li><b>X-ray Machines: </b>Standard and digital X-rays for imaging bones, lungs, and other internal structures.</li>
                <li><b>CT (Computed Tomography) Scanners: </b>Provides detailed cross-sectional images of the body for diagnosing a wide range of conditions.</li>
                <li><b>MRI (Magnetic Resonance Imaging) Scanners: </b>Uses magnetic fields and radio waves to produce detailed images of organs and tissues, especially useful for brain, spine, and joint imaging.</li>
            </ul>
